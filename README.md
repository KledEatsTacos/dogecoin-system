# Dogecoin System
This is my (very buggy) second assignment for my Introduction to Programming class.
The program simulates a banking system with two types of accounts: general and special, and integrates Dogecoin cryptocurrency transactions.

## Features
- Create and manage general and special accounts
- Deposit and withdraw money from accounts.
- Buy and sell Dogecoin.
- Update Dogecoin value periodically based on account type.
- Calculate profit or loss for a certain account
- Simulate time progression to update account transactions
